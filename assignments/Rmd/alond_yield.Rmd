Your goal is to implement a simple model of almond yield anomaly response to climate
- Inputs: daily times series of minimum, maximum daily temperatures and precipitation
- Outputs: maximum, minimum and mean yield anomoly for a input time series
The Lobell et al. 2006 paper will be the source for the transfer function that you will use in your model; specifically look at the equations in table 2.

Grading 
- a clear diagram that corresponds with your R function (10 pts) 
- inputs and output and parameters shown on the diagram (10 pts)
- correct function implementation (*.R file) (10 pts)
- application of the function to clim.txt (in Rmarkdown file) (10 pts)
- coding practices (clear documentation, informative variables names) (10 pts)

# Draw the Model

# Implement Model in R
- create an R file that has your function definition

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here("assignments","img","hw1_diagram.png"))
```

```{r read_n_wrangle}
#clim <- read.delim('/Users/lunacatalan/Documents/dev/eds230/eds-230-modeling/assignments/clim.txt',
 #                  header = TRUE,
  #                 sep = " ")

clim <- read.delim(here('assignments','clim.txt'),
                   header = TRUE,
                   sep = " ")

# select month for almond yields
feb_temp <- clim %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(month == 2) %>% 
  summarize(tmin_c = min(tmin_c),
            # not directly called in code, so commenting out for now
           # tmax_c = max(tmax_c)
           )

# select precipitation for almond yields
jan_precip <- clim %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(month == 1) %>% 
  summarize(precip = sum(precip))

# join the datasets
almond_clim <- left_join(feb_temp, jan_precip)
```
```{r yield_function}
# EQUATION 
almond_func <- function(df){
  
  yields <- data.frame()
  
  # iterate over the rows to get yields
  for(date in 1:nrow(df)) {
    
    T_min = df$tmin_c[date]
    P = df$precip[date]
    
    Y_min = (-0.015*T_min) - (0.0046*(T_min**2)) - (0.07*P) + (0.0043*(P^2)) + 0.28
    
    calculations <- data.frame(Y_min = Y_min)
    
    yields <-  rbind(yields, calculations)
  }
  
  yield <- data.frame(
    Ymax = max(yields),
    Ymin = min(yields),
    Ymean = mean(yields$Y_min)
  )
  
  return(yield)
}
```

# Run the Model
- apply the function to the test climate data (clim.txt)
```{r run_model}
almond_yield <- almond_func(almond_clim)

almond_yield
```

# Check Work

- the maximum almond yield anomaly should be approximately 1920 ton/acre 
- the lowest almond yield anomaly should be approximately -0.027 ton/acre 
- the mean almond yield anomaly should be approximately 182 ton/acre


```{r practice-chunk}
#yields <- data.frame()

# iterate over the rows to get yields
#for(date in 1:nrow(almond_clim)) {
  
 # T_min = almond_clim$tmin_c[date]
  #P = almond_clim$precip[date]
  
  #Y_min = (-0.015*T_min) - (0.0046*(T_min**2)) - (0.07*P) + (0.0043*(P^2)) + 0.28
  
#  calculations <- data.frame(Y_min = Y_min)
  
 # yields <-  rbind(yields, calculations)
#}

#max(yields)
#min(yields)
#mean(yields$Y_min)
```


# Assignment 3: Next steps

Develop a profit model for your almond yield (you can make this up - think about what the parameters would be)
- Negatives: cost of farming (eg. price of water, land rent, fertilizer, labor, machinery) 
- Positives: amount of yield (per tree?), market almond price (multiply this with the yield parameter - they have to be in the same unit)

```{r}

almond_profit <- function(costs, yield, market_price) {
  
  profit = yield*market_price - costs
  
}

```


Do a simple informal sensitivity analysis of almond yield profit using at least 2 parameters
- Costs of water could change by year / rainfall
- Price of labor or fertilizer

Create 2 graphs of the results - you can decide what is the most meaningful graph 

* Write a short paragraph (in the Rmarkdown document) to summarize you interpretation of your model results (e.g what do 'take away' from your model and sensitivity analysis)
