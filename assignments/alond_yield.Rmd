Your goal is to implement a simple model of almond yield anomaly response to climate
- Inputs: daily times series of minimum, maximum daily temperatures and precipitation
- Outputs: maximum, minimum and mean yield anomoly for a input time series
The Lobell et al. 2006 paper will be the source for the transfer function that you will use in your model; specifically look at the equations in table 2.

Grading 
- a clear diagram that corresponds with your R function (10 pts) 
- inputs and output and parameters shown on the diagram (10 pts)
- correct function implementation (*.R file) (10 pts)
- application of the function to clim.txt (in Rmarkdown file) (10 pts)
- coding practices (clear documentation, informative variables names) (10 pts)

# Draw the Model

# Implement Model in R
- create an R file that has your function definition

# Run the Model
- apply the function to the test climate data (clim.txt)

# Check Work

- the maximum almond yield anomaly should be approximately 1920 ton/acre 
- the lowest almond yield anomaly should be approximately -0.027 ton/acre 
- the mean almond yield anomaly should be approximately 182 ton/acre
